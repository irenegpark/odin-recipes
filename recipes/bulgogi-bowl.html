    <p>The Bulgogi Bowl is a simple recipe. Bulgogi is usually marinated thin shaved slices of beef. This dish, however, uses ground beef. The whole recipe is anxiety-free and takes only a few minutes. You will feel like you are eating your Korean mother's home cooked meal.</p>
    <ul>Ingredients
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame seed oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>minced garlic, to taste</li>
        <li>minced ginger</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup cooked brown rice</li>
        <li>1 head romaine lettuce, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cucumber, diced</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>Steps
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Mix in sesame oil.</li>
        <li>Combine soy sauce, water, garlic, ginger, red pepper flakes, and black pepper in a food processor. Blend until combined but still slightly chunky. Pour mixture into the skillet with the beef and cook over medium heat until most of the liquid evaporates, 7 to 9 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place 1/4 the cooked brown rice in the bottom of an individual serving bowl. Top with a portion of beef mixture, lettuce, cucumber, and sesame seeds. Repeat with remaining rice, beef, and toppings.</li>
    </ol>
